To-Do List Application

Duration: 2 weeks

Welcome to my To-Do List application! This simple yet powerful tool helps you organize your tasks and manage your time efficiently. Whether you're planning your day, week, or month, this app is designed to streamline your workflow and boost productivity.

Installation
1.Create a database named weekend-to-do-app
2.The queries in database.sql are set up to create all required tables. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure you have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was what I used to create them.
3.Open your editor of choice and run npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5.Run npm run client in your terminal

Features:
Task Management: Easily add, edit, and delete tasks as needed. Keep track of all your to-dos in one convenient place.

Usage
Type your task into the text field and click the add button to add a task.
Click the toggle switch to set task as completed or not.
Tasks can be removed all at once via the reset button, or one at a time with the delete button next to each task.
